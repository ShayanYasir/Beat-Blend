# Beat-Blend
Tired of the same 10 songs playing on Spotify? We fixed it.


The True Shuffle functionality is currently a work in progress. All of the other API integrations have been completed and are fully deployed on [Vercel](https://beat-blend-alpha.vercel.app/).

To use the app, please send me the email address you used for your Spotify account. The Spotify API only allows registered users to interact with small projects like this one. 

To run locally, use `python3 -m http.server 8000`!
